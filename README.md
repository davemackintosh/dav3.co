A simple blogging platform built with

* React (although a Switch to Preact is likely)
* TypeScript
* Webpack
* NodeJS

that takes your markdown and gives you a development server via webpack-dev-server or builds 100% JavaScript free static HTML. even for parametric routes.

it is entirely yours to do what you want with (MIT License) and nothing is hidden in dependencies or abstraction. Want to change how links are rendered from markdown, edit the component. Want to add your own custom behaviour to your markdown code snippets? edit the component. 

its just a react app and a simple build script (less than 200 lines of code to turn a react app to static html)
