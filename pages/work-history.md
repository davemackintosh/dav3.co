I use technology to solve problems, I pick the appropriate technology to solve the problem at the highest speed and quality I can. I enjoy solving all kinds of problems from team organisation and member learning to complex automation platforms and creative visuals.

Half of my career has been in developing creative, visual and interactive works of art for clients like Harrods, Google and the other half of my career to date has been developing software to automate away national client's business problems and to consolidate third party apps and APIs into single source of truth business platforms.
