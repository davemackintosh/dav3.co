Dave is a talented and passionate team player and leader. Iâ€™m glad to work with him. We spent hours coding from scratch together, and he created a supportive atmosphere where I knew that, if something went wrong, we would overcome it together. I admire his experience, his adeptness at transitioning between programming languages, technologies and tasks, understanding business needs, product considerations, and ability to ask right questions. Dave can easily initiate projects from scratch, provide ongoing support and drive continuous improvements. In our team, he definitely helped us achieve our goals, made difficult decisions, and led us in the right direction. Any projects/companies would find him highly impactful and valuable ~ Alina Sauchuk
