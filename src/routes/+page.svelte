		With over two decades of experience in the software development industry, I have had the
		privilege of working with esteemed clients like Google, ABRSM, Sleepio, Skoda, The National Army
		Museum, and various other local brands. My journey has been defined by a deep commitment to
		putting people first and ensuring that technology serves as a powerful tool to enhance their
		lives.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a seasoned professional who has not only run a successful business solo for a decade but also
		contributed to and led numerous projects, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and
		leadership skills to the table. Now, I am eagerly seeking a new challenge as a Chief Technology
		Officer (CTO) to steer a company towards greater heights.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout my career, I have emphasized delivering stable code that is not only highly
		performant but also maintainable and readable. I firmly believe that a well-architected and
		thoroughly understood codebase is the foundation for long-term success in any project.
	</p>
	<p>
		My approach is marked by a comprehensive discovery process, wherein I collaborate closely with
		you to understand your mission, goals, and aspirations for your product. By uncovering the
		essence of what makes your offering exceptional in its class, I can craft a technology strategy
		that aligns seamlessly with your vision.
