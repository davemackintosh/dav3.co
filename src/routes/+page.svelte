		With over two decades of experience in the software development industry, I have had the
		privilege of working with esteemed clients like Google, ABRSM, Sleepio, Skoda, The National Army
		Museum, and many many local brands. My journey has been defined by a deep commitment to putting
		people first and ensuring that technology serves as a powerful tool to enhance their lives.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a seasoned professional who has not only run a successful business solo for a decade but also
		contributed to and led numerous projects, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and
		leadership skills to the table.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout my career, I have emphasized delivering stable code that is not only highly
		performant but also maintainable and readable. I firmly believe that a well-architected and
		thoroughly understood codebase is the foundation for long-term success in any project.
